         <h3 class="masonry-title">&#9312; Who?</h3>
         <p class="masonry-description">My name is Akshaya Satheesh. <br><br>I'm a 23 year old Sports Science graduate residing in Greater London. <br><Br> I am both a creative and logical professional, although my personality oozes with more of the former.</p>

         <h3 class="masonry-title">&#9313; My Story</h3>
         <p class="masonry-description">While I grew up focused on my passion for fitness and health, it was not until after I had graduated and began experiencing adult life that I soon realised what I had expected was not my reality. <br><br> I was not happy with my job in the fitness industry, so I decided to quit and figure out what my other passions could possibly be.</p>

       <div class="masonry-content">
         <h3 class="masonry-title">&#9314; How did it begin?</h3>
         <p class="masonry-description">It began with helping my mum set up her own online SEO business. <br><br>I worked on a few wordpress pages, sifting through tech trends and designs that could benefit her business' website.<br><br> As she drew in clients, I also aided in a few client websites, dabbling in designing logos and editing the html and css.</p>

       <div class="masonry-content">
         <h3 class="masonry-title">&#9315; How did I get here?</h3>
         <p class="masonry-description">All of the new experiences in tech brought me back to a part of my childhood I forgot about - editing the html and css on tumblr blogs. <br><br>I had forgotten about my (undeveloped) interest in designing and developing a beautiful website. <br><br> As my mum has a background in IT, she advised me to use free online resources and play around to see if coding was my thing.<br><br> That's when I came across Founders & Coders and fell in love with their amazing projects that have come out of pure hardwork, altruism and vision.</p>

         <h3 class="masonry-title">&#9316; My Visions</h3>
         <p class="masonry-description">After nearly half a year of self-schooling using the online resources required in the application prerequisite and other amazing tutorials I've come across, I have begun my journey into coding.<br><br>My passion extends in every new piece of design or project I am given and I wish to take full advantage of the amazing programme in order to come out a much more successful and knowledgable developer. <br><br>I am excited to learn more programming languages and in more extensive detail, as I have the desire to create meaningful tech that can overcome real-life challenges.</p>
